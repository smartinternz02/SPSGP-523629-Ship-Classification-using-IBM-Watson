# Ship-Classification-
Ship classification using AI involves using techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a neural network.


# RESULT

A deep learning model for ship classification was built using transfer learning techniques with the VGG16 architecture. The model achieved an accuracy of 78.1% on the training set and 76.67% on the testing set.
